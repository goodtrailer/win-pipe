# win-pipe
Single-file C++ library for Windows named pipes.

Uses Windows's named pipes for inter-process communication. Pipes are inbound, meaning data is sent from client to server.

Written in the space of 45 minutes and completely untested. I haven't run it once yet. Just kinda hoping it works when I use it eventually. Use at your own risk :)
